5 layer model
	1.physical layer
	2.data link layer ethernet WIFI
		common signal define at this layer
	3.network IP
		allow different network connect with each other 
	4.transport layer tcp/udp
		tcp/udp   tcp data relaible transport 
	5.application layer 
		http

cable Cables are what connect different devices to each other allowing data to be transmitted over them.
hub a phiscal layer device that allows for connections from many computers at once 
switch send signal between each device 
router forward data between independent networks 
border gateway protocol
modulation a way of varying the voltage of this charge moving across the cable 

ethernet
CSMA/CD
A MAC address is a globally unique identifier attach to an individual network interface  is a 48 bit number
represent by 6 groups of 2 hexdecimal number 

unicast frame 
multicast frame
broadcast   address ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:Ff

discecting an ethernet 
ethernet frame preamble destination address  sources address vlan tag    type  pay load	 	FCS
		8byte		6byte		6byte		4byte	2byte	data 46-1500byte	4byte

IP adress
	32bit long
	static IP address 
	dynamic IP address

IP datagram	0-4 bit version such as ipv4
		4-8 bit header length field  20 length when dealing with ipv4
		8-16 service type field  qos technology
		16-32 total length field  indicate the total length of the IP datagram it attach to
		identification  check whether it's same datagram
		flag/fragment offset whether it need and how many pieces it split into 
		TTL time to live how many router hops it could pass 
		protocol whcich protocol to use 
		header checksum same as the ethernet checksum
		source ip address
		destination ip adress
		ip option field  set speical characteristics for datagrams primarily used for testing purpose
		padding 

ip address network id and host id  
	calss aï¼Œb,c address  a 0-126  b 128-191 c 192-223

how the data link layer and network layer relate to each other 
address resolution protocol 
 used to discover a hardware address node with a certain ip address
 
 subnet
 subnet mask 
 	network id identify network 
	host id identify individual host
	subnet id two part
		a part of number with ones which could ignore when computing host id 

CIDR
	classes inter-domain routing

router
	a network device that forwards traffic depending on the destination address of that traffic 

basic routing 4 steps 
	1.recieve data pack 
	2.examines destination ip
	3.look up ip destination network in routing table 
	4.forward data to destination

the process of send one data from one computer to other computer through internet 
	1. the computer A  send the package to MAC address of its gateway the router.
	2.the router take the data and duplicate it, decrement the TTL and calcualte a new checksum
	3. encapusulate the new IP datagram into a new ethernet frame. set the mac address as computer B
	4. the data get delieveyed

routing table 4 column 
	1. destination network  network id and mask /CDIR
	2. next hop  next router that should recive data indend for the destination network
	3. total hops calculate the best path
	4. interface 

routing protocol
	interrior gateway protocol
		share info between single autonmous system
		1.link-state protocol 
			complex use algo to determine the best path 
		2.distance vector protocol
		
	exterior  gateway protocol
		used between independent system
		iana internet assigned number authority(ip allocation) resposible for autonomous system number allocation

	
	two router could influce their router table 
	router use link-state protocol to determine the best path 

non-routable address space
